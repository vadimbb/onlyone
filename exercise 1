BACK-END (JSON object)
a) By using the method `/igc/betspin/rewards/history` with only 1 param `userName`, 
   we will get a JSON with an array of unique tokens claimed by that user.
   Scenario 1: check that using a method we get correct JSON
   Given method is used correctly
   And only 1 parameter `userName` is used
   Then we get a JSON with an array of unique tokens claimed by that user
   
b) Each unique token claimed could have been claimed more than once (sub-array objects)
   Scenario 2: check that unique token can be claimed more than once
   Given token has been claimed
   Then we can use same unique token more than once again

c) The following info will be contained for each sub-array object: game-slug,date 
   claimed, info, reason, expiry date.
   Scenario 3: check that correct info is present for each object
   Given object has info fields
   Then those fields are "game-slug,date claimed, info, reason, expiry date."
   
d) The response will be in chronological order in the array and sub-array.
   Scenario 4: check that order in response is correct
   Given response is received
   Then the response will be in chronological order
